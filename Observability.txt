~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~monitor and obervalibilty~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``
monitoring - tell you : when somthing is wrong with your system
- in dashboad we can see what happen, like system ran out of cpu, memit will use the dashboard.
- you can set alert also 
observalibity:
it will tell why sytem went down what is th ereson cpu is more (which process conuming teh more resouvrce)
- what are the logs, traces, errro messgaes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~how you emit the custom logs and metrics in application~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~```
developer using the opebtelmeterty like counter is using in the application code .

prometheous exporter, node exporter give cpu, mem mertixs 
but custom logs ex: paymnet count 
every prpomagramming language nbased oon lan they use teh logging framework (log4j for java) here developer define log format like error, info,debug like that.
how: 
ex: payment count.
1. developwe use the prometheous client in there application .
2. use the counterUuse te gauge counter metrics)  , so prometheius client import servers and count the application and show it in the dashboard. (counter is always incremental)
3. application developer instruments the metrics by the opentelemetery (its open source)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~what kind of metrics worked with current project~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~````
infrastur realted metrics -node exporter- no related things(cpu, memory)
2. kuberenets worker componets - liek kubelet and etcd
3. application related metrisc
4. vo services and docker relted kuberenets related , service now, linux releted like cpu, process 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`have you worked in observability yes? explain~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~```
ask devolper to instrument the custom metrixs
paymnet metrics.
explain the claim service.> ability to observer internal state of appliication (cpu, disk, memory)
logs and traces 
more request- payment serice is going down > implement the log4j framework > i set up prometheous and grafana > trcing user eager >developer instrument custom metrics by opentelmetery
