~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`what is the difference betwwen the metrics , logs and trace give me one examople with payment service?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``


metrics: what is cpu, mem, error time, https request count in th form of numerical data 
logs - humab readable format with timestammp it will show . full journey flow will show
trcaes- it will show like logs but its debugging inosde service, like services is calling to anothere services that how much time take take responf=d , what is the latency, bootlenecks so we can find entire thing : koging fframework : set teh error, trace, info, debug like .


Metrics measure the overall health and performance of a system with numerical data points collected over time (e.g., CPU usage, request rates, error counts). They answer what is happening and serve well for alerting and identifying trends because they are compact and aggregated.

Logs provide a detailed, timestamped record of discrete events and activities within the system. Logs help understand why something happened by offering contextual, human-readable data for troubleshooting specific issues.

Traces show the journey of a request or transaction through multiple components or services, giving insight into the exact where and how in the flow of operations, enabling identification of bottlenecks or failures in complex systems.

Example with a Payment Service
Imagine a payment service handling online payments:

Metric: The total number of payment transactions processed successfully per minute, or the rate of payment failures. (Shows what is going on, e.g., “Payment failure rate increased to 5%.”)

Trace: A distributed trace follows a single payment request from the API gateway through authentication, payment processing, and confirmation services, showing delays or errors in any step. (Shows where the failure or slow down occurred in the payment flow.)

Log: Detailed log entries record the error messages when a payment transaction fails, such as timeout errors from the payment gateway or invalid card details logged during that specific payment attempt. (Shows why the payment failed.)
