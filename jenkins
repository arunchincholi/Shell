1. master and salve setup
2. craeted users and roes for developers
3, craeted some jar jobs like myaccount and pcsps 
4. some issue (svn password expire, post movemebt server password expires, compliation error, restart the jenkins via (ui and CLI)
5. craete one disk space job and alerrt will send to email notification 
6.caete war deploymnet via ANT, mvn 
7. jenkins private ip - we are mentioning in jenkins , jenkins public ip movingg to destination authorization
8. check all steps manually how to build manualllay  
9. checkout svn we are passing the ba id and password is there any way to do password less authetiaction


 ###########################what i sthe jenkins shared libarray and how they work ######################################
we have multiple developemnet teams 
- all teams required pipeline. some of the  satage is remains same liek build , deploying  steps, so we are using the  jenkins shared library for that.
- craete githiub>placed the jenkins shared library - if new requirement we will check that jenkins shared library we can use that(invoke shared library) else create pipeline in tjhe jenkinsfile from scratch
- by using this time will save

#####################top 5 build target taht you use with maven frequently#############################################333
maven - build language 
gradle, ANT
- 
MAVEN----------5 commads 
1. mvn clean - it will clean the /target folder (previous build like jar, war, artifactory)
2. mvn compile - developer wriet java code>compile teh sorce code (src/main/java)
3. mvn test - test the sorce code - src/test/java
4. mvn package - pacahe the code (it will craete the jar or war file )
5. mvn install - install or place the build artifactory (like target folder and jar )into one extertranl repository or move the respective remote server. (artifactiry repository )
              - by default the all things stored in the ~/.m2 folder thsi is the default folder alll crated target and artifactory stored in m32 folder only. 

###############which artifactory repositiry do you use for builds################################################3
in my earler project i am using teh nexus as artifact repository,>we are created the jar,war,ear >we are keeping alll those in teh nexus repo>that we mention in the pom.xml (credntial and which palec store)
>developer go that theat plavce and download as per theier requiremnet.
1. how the teh artifactory repo configuration in pom.xml ?
2, why nexus yo use why not jfrog?
3. how tos etup teh nexus repo and how the place in mvn file. and how developer cn aaccess teh artifactr repo.

#######################how you cofnigure artifactory for maven application##############################333
in maven one setting.xml is there> you can craete repo profile within that configure repository and repository location.
- if you are using the multiple repo (url/repositoty path) or specific job you need to mention the repository path different then - insde po.xml <under distruvutaionmanagemnet add the repo id an durl>

################################build passed localy not in CI###########################################
all steps:
1. what exctly like build language depend
approach :
~ logs - i wi;; check teh first build log >if any error ok >else i will cgo forward
~ Dependency cache - in local without mvn cleans it mighht work but in jenkins its cache issue >i will add mvn clean sthen mvn install
~ env - in local enviornmnetal variable are there but via jenkins we are buildiing s jennkins agent didint read that variable so that i sissue 
    Q! - gie me ne exmaple
~ file permisstion - jenkinsagent has no file permisstion for executing so that is also issue i will check and gibe the permisstion and trigger the job
Q1 - tell me one example
~ compre with some OS, linux distrubution- from local server ip and jenkins server ip 
Q1- gibe me one exmaple what you faced 1 issue and how you fixed.

#################################CI pipeline Successed but application broken in prod#########################################
1. issue with traffic,
2.deployment strategy (canery deploymnet 10 % users access the new version of custmers(internal ) -will keep the 2 days gradutually increased to 50%,eventually  100%
3. something can be taken care by the build steps i cahcek stage and prod (compare different build flags)
1. base
d on the traffic (application broken>check logs>describe pod>crashloopback why?- because of failur fuction, OOMM killed- due to traffic
i request tester to perform the load testing on QA enviormnen.
2. compare teh stage and prpod (instance typr, 5 node cluster, where as stage 3 node cluster)

##############################pipeline slow down over a time(buuild takes more time)#########################################################
pipline job taking more time to execute.
approach:
1. parrallsim:only one agent or 4 ci cd pilinne run (concurrency )
2. build cache: for evey build sam emenas 10 build 11 build - you can take the cache layer from the old build so that we can reduce time.
memory issue- verticle scaling-increse swap

########################devloper pushes feature branch but pipeline doent trigger###############################3333
1. what- i will check CI file 
githubaction yaml file- withing githubfuuction yaml file (in on filed what brach is tere under push if amin chage it to feture branch name , if pull not there confifure )
- on:push:branched:- * : * feture (exclude the branch like *deturebranch )
