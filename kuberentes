-----------------KUERENETS ARCHETECTURE-----------------------------
#### 📌 1. **API Server**

* It's the front door to the cluster.
* Handles REST calls (`kubectl`, client apps).
* Talks to:

  * etcd (for storage)
  * Scheduler (for scheduling decisions)
  * Controller Manager (for maintaining state)
  * Kubelets (on worker nodes)

---

#### 📌 2. **Scheduler**

* Gets **unscheduled pods** from API Server.
* Picks a **best-fit node** based on:

  * Resource availability (CPU/memory)
  * Node affinity/anti-affinity
  * Taints & tolerations
  * Pod priority
  * Constraints (e.g., zones, labels)
* Tells API Server: “Schedule this pod on Node-3”

> 🧠 **Scheduler does *not* start containers. It just decides where the pod should go.**

---

#### 📌 3. **API Server (Again)**

* Updates the Pod object with assigned node info.
* Communicates this to the **Kubelet on that node**.

---

#### 📌 4. **Kubelet (on worker node)**

* Watches API Server for pods scheduled to it.
* Talks to:

  * **Container runtime (like containerd/Docker)** to run the pod.
  * **kube-proxy** to update networking rules.

---

#### 📌 5. **Container Runtime**

* Starts the actual containers inside the Pod.

---

#### 📌 6. **kube-proxy (on worker node)**

* Manages iptables or IPVS rules.
* Forwards traffic to pods using:

  * ClusterIP services
  * NodePort
  * LoadBalancer
* Helps in **Service discovery and routing**.

---

#### 📌 7. **etcd**

* The key-value store of the cluster.
* Stores:

  * Configurations
  * Pod specs
  * Secrets
  * Service info
  * State of the entire cluster
* Data Format: **JSON**, internally stored in protobuf (efficient binary format).

---

#### 📌 8. **Controller Manager**

* Monitors desired vs actual state using control loops.
* Examples:

  * Deployment Controller
  * Node Controller
  * ReplicaSet Controller
* Ensures the cluster always matches the desired config.

> 📢 It's mandatory for maintaining state & healing.

---

### ✅ EKS (Amazon Kubernetes Service)

In **EKS**, the **Control Plane is fully managed by AWS**:

* You don’t manage API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Scheduler.
* AWS scales and manages high availability, upgrades, backups.

You only manage:

* **Worker nodes (EC2)** or **Fargate pods**
* **kubectl**
* **IAM roles, networking, security, and manifests**


### ✅ Summary Table

| Component          | Role                                | Who Runs It    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| API Server         | Entry point, handles requests       | Master         |
| Scheduler          | Chooses node for Pod                | Master         |
| etcd               | Stores all state                    | Master         |
| Controller Manager | Reconciles desired vs current state | Master         |
| Kubelet            | Runs on node, starts containers     | Worker Node    |
| Container Runtime  | Pulls image, runs containers        | Worker Node    |
| kube-proxy         | Sets up network rules for services  | Worker Node    |
| EKS Control Plane  | Fully managed (you don’t control)   | Managed by AWS |
 
-------------------------------what i steh service and how it will be -----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's break your questions down one by one and answer with clear Kubernetes real-time DevOps understanding, including where YAML definitions are placed and why companies make certain choices.

---

### 🔶 **1. What is the purpose of a Service in Kubernetes? Is it mandatory?**

**Purpose:**

* A **Kubernetes Service** provides a **stable network identity (IP + DNS name)** to access a set of Pods.
* Since Pods are ephemeral (they can restart anytime with a different IP), Services abstract the underlying dynamic Pod IPs and give a **single access point** to them.

**Is it mandatory?**

* Yes, **in real-world applications**, Services are **mandatory** to expose and access your applications:

  * Internal: app-to-app communication (e.g., frontend → backend)
  * External: users accessing apps from outside (via LoadBalancer or Ingress)

---

### 🔶 **2. On what basis do we learn or choose Services? What are the types?**

**Basis to learn/choose:**

* Based on **where the consumer lives** (inside cluster vs outside)
* Based on **network exposure need** (internal-only or public-facing)
* Based on **cloud provider support** (e.g., LoadBalancer needs cloud support)

**Types of Services:**

| Service Type   | Use Case                                      | Exposes To                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `ClusterIP`    | Default. Used for internal communication      | Inside the cluster only       |
| `NodePort`     | Exposes service on a static port of each node | Outside (via `<NodeIP>:Port`) |
| `LoadBalancer` | Creates a cloud provider Load Balancer        | Outside via LB IP             |
| `ExternalName` | Maps a service to an external DNS name        | External services (e.g., DBs) |

---

### 🔶 **3. What is `ClusterIP` and where/when can we use it?**

**Where/When:**

* Use `ClusterIP` when **one Pod wants to talk to another** within the cluster.
* Example: Frontend → Backend, or microservices talking inside the cluster.

**Where to define it:**

```yaml
# In service.yaml
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Common for:**

* Internal microservice communication
* Backend APIs, Databases

---

### 🔶 **4. What is NodePort and LoadBalancer Service? Which is better?**

| Type         | Description                                                                 | Use Case                               | Drawbacks                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| NodePort     | Exposes service on a fixed port on each node’s IP                           | Simple cluster, testing, on-prem setup | Manual DNS setup, security risk, no auto-scaling |
| LoadBalancer | Provisions a public LoadBalancer via Cloud Provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) | Real production workloads on cloud     | Cost, dependent on cloud provider support        |

**Which is better?**

* ✅ **LoadBalancer** is preferred for production **cloud** deployments:

  * Auto DNS, managed IPs, cloud-native scaling, secure

---

### 🔶 **5. Why not use NodePort in place of LoadBalancer? Disadvantages of NodePort**

**Disadvantages of NodePort:**

* Exposes **every node**, so it's less secure.
* You need to manage **external DNS** or Load Balancer yourself.
* **Port collision** may occur (e.g., only ports 30000–32767 allowed).
* No **health-check integration**, no **auto-scaling** or **smart routing**.

**So in real-world cloud setups**, LoadBalancer is preferred due to:

* **Managed** and **scalable** public access
* Built-in health checks, SSL support via Ingress

---

### 🔶 **6. Why some companies stick to NodePort and ClusterIP only?**

**Common Reasons:**

* They're **on-premises**, not on cloud → no support for cloud LoadBalancers.
* They have **external reverse proxies** (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy) managing routing.
* They want **tighter control** over network exposure for security.

**Example Setup:**

* Internal: ClusterIP for services
* External: NodePort + NGINX ingress controller on bare-metal

---

### 🔶 **7. Where to define `labels` and `selectors` for Service Discovery?**

Service and Deployment must be connected using **labels and selectors**.

#### 🟩 In Deployment YAML (e.g., `deployment.yaml`):

```yaml
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    app: myapp               # ← Define label here

spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp           # ← Pod will have this label
```

#### 🟦 In Service YAML (e.g., `service.yaml`):

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp               # ← Selector matches the Pod's label
```

> 🔑 **Selector in service should match label in pod template** (inside Deployment). This links the service to those Pods.

---

### 🔄 Real-Time Flow Example:

1. **Deployment.yaml**

   * Creates Pods with label: `app: backend`

2. **Service.yaml**

   * `selector: app: backend` → targets those Pods

3. **Type: ClusterIP or LoadBalancer**

   * ClusterIP used internally
   * LoadBalancer exposed to the internet

---

### ✅ Summary Table:

| Aspect              | ClusterIP           | NodePort               | LoadBalancer       |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Access Scope        | Internal only       | External via NodeIP    | External via LB IP |
| Use in Prod         | Yes (internal apps) | Rare (on-prem or test) | Yes (cloud)        |
| YAML `type`         | `ClusterIP`         | `NodePort`             | `LoadBalancer`     |
| Need Selector?      | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes              |
| DNS/Port Management | K8s handles         | Manual                 | Cloud handles      |

If you want, I can give a sample `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` for all 3 service types side-by-side with comments for each. Let me know.

############################developer mention the pod ip in teh pod b property via hardcode pod ip is mentioned is te goood practc#######################################################3
no - pod are emphermaerla in nature , it migh change the ip everytime when the restart/crashllopback/wendown and coomeback >so 502 badgateway will come >again specify ip >else use service via labels and selector algorthic communication will happe.
deploymnet L labels (under template-template hashcode , service.yaml - selector name should be same )
so when it comeback comminucation over label and selector not via ip.
pod 1 frontend and podb is backend .


######################what are types of kuberenets #######################################################3
type of services - based on scope how the servicice is accessble (scope of access)
cluster ip - only withing k8s cliuster -  
node port - kuberente access via useing the node port and port 
load balnacer - enable public access to externally, anyone can acces, this type only works on kuberente cluster (not minikube, kind)
external name - when we define external name , external access through DNS name.
headless service - cluster ip to none headless service will create , it will use in statefullset(like database)

##################label and selector###########################3
label is a key and value pair, we need to add under metadata of deploymnet/pod object 
selectore - to identfy the pod using te label - use the service and replicaset object 
#################################service##########################33
cliustr -a cces inside cluster
nodeport- whoever access within vpc , via node ipand port, headache to remenber the ip, no HA, no defualt autoscaling, SSLand TLS configuration default
loadbalncer- outside userd like our online inurnace   (only have achive in luberenet cluster which have cloud control manager enabled or controller manager running on the controla node .
