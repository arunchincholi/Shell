Morning Stand-up (Agile Ceremony):
“Each morning, I participate in our Agile daily stand-up meetings, where we quickly align on project status, discuss blockers, and synchronize priorities with the team.”

Task Tracking in Jira: head to jira will see 
“I regularly update my progress in Jira, where all our tasks, stories, and bugs are tracked. After the stand-up, I check my Jira board, review the day’s priorities, and pick up tickets assigned to me. I make sure to move tickets to the correct status as I make progress.”

Infrastructure Work with Terraform:
“My technical tasks often include writing or updating Terraform code to provision and manage infrastructure as code. I ensure my changes are versioned in Git, reviewed through pull requests, and tested before merging.”

Afternoon Check-ins or Meetings: deployment day (deploymnet overview call) - will connect with all leads , developer and manger over there we line items , copmonets overvew callall.
“In the afternoon, we might have additional team meetings for sprint planning or retrospectives, or I join discussions to troubleshoot incidents or collaborate on complex deployments.”
Continuous Jira Updates:

EOD:
“I keep Jira updated throughout the day—commenting on tickets, moving them to ‘In Progress’, ‘Ready for Review’, or ‘Done’ as needed, so the team always has an accurate status.”

devopment(build stage)- based on code develop the code as per BRD
testing- QA yest the code as per test cases (give signoff who ? stake hodler willl give sinoff for uat test) so we are moving teh signoff componets only to prod development.
deployemnet - deplyment code to production serevrs (like jenkins, manually, via ansibe, via shwll script)
