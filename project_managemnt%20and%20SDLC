Task Tracking in Jira: head to jira will see 
“I regularly update my progress in Jira, where all our tasks, stories, and bugs are tracked. After the stand-up, I check my Jira board, review the day’s priorities, and pick up tickets assigned to me. I make sure to move tickets to the correct status as I make progress.”

Infrastructure Work with Terraform:
“My technical tasks often include writing or updating Terraform code to provision and manage infrastructure as code. I ensure my changes are versioned in Git, reviewed through pull requests, and tested before merging.”

Afternoon Check-ins or Meetings: deployment day (deploymnet overview call) - will connect with all leads , developer and manger over there we line items , copmonets overvew callall.

devopment(build stage)- based on code develop the code as per BRD
testing- QA yest the code as per test cases (give signoff who ? stake hodler willl give sinoff for uat test) so we are moving teh signoff componets only to prod development.
deployemnet - deplyment code to production serevrs (like jenkins, manually, via ansibe, via shwll script)
